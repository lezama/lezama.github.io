We make the Items Specification via an [[XSD|XML schema]]. Users can create an xml file for describing their product and then insert it on the respective clause of the [[SXP Contract]].

==Structure of SXP Item schema==



The SXP Item schema is an [[XSD|XML schema]], and gives a description of the items. Note that items here means products and services. It provides the following entries:

*Item Description. General description of the product. It includes: 
**Title (mandatory).
**Brand.
**Color.
**Dimensions.
**Description. A narrative description of the item.
**Item information URL. An Url with information of the item.
**Item picture URL. An Url with a picture of the item.
**Number of Items. 


*Item Category. It classifies the product in categories such as:
**Clothing
**Sports
**Beauty
**...
There are also several categories for services:
**Teaching 
**Personal Caring
**Transport
**Other Services

Currently, it is only possible to select the category of the product. We may want to extend this and subdivide each category, or add specific information (e.g. duration on services, subcategories)
