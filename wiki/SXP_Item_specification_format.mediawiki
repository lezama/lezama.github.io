We do the Items Specification via an XML schema (XSD), which is one of the possible ways to define an XML structure.

==SXP Products schema==

The SXP Product schema is an [[XML schema]], and gives a description of the items. Note that items here means products and services. It provides the following entries:

*External URL (optional). An Url with information about the product.

*Number of Items (optional). 

*Description Data (optional).
**Title.
**Brand.
**Designer
**Description.

*Product Data. It classifies the product in categories such as:
**Clothing
**Sports
**Beauty
**...
There are also several categories for services:
**Teaching 
**Personal Caring
**Transport

Currently, it is only possible to select the category and add a text description of the product. We may want to extend this and subdivide each category, or add specific information (e.g. duration on services)
