The Secure Contract Signing protocol of [SXP](/wiki/Main_Page "wikilink") is a
[Protocol](/wiki/Protocols "wikilink").

**Current status: It remains to be defined. It is the first important
technical task ahead of us.**

What should it do?
------------------

Allow several parties to sign a contract securely.

-   But what do we mean by secure in this case?
-   Are we going to rely on a Trusted Third Party?

Some related papers we must understand first
