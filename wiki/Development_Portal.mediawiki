==Stages==
The foreseen stages of the project are: 
# Know what the protocols aim to achieve
# Formalize the required properties of the protocols
# Formalize the protocols with the required properties
# Launch the implementations of these protocols
# Produce the graphical interfaces to these implementations
# Play with it

==Status==

Mostly the project is at stage 1: we know the aims of this project. 
Some subtasks are more advanced, for instance:
* The design the [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol|Secure Contract Signing protocol]] is stage 4.

The next tasks belong to stage 2, which is still very much a research stage. Here are some of the most obvious tasks:
* Understand [[Private Contract Signatures]].
* Describe the XML format of [[Contracts]].

==Methodology==

===Top-down===
The design approach is top-down: we need to know what we want better and better, with increased precision, until the stage where knowing what we want means having it.

===Collaborative=== 
The other stages are entirely in the hands of the community that will develop the project. Notice that this is eased by the fact that until stage 6 is reached, no software development is needed. Hence everything can happen on this Website, or links to contributing papers, until then. This website as you may notice is a Wiki: we hope that its content will converge to a consensus reached by its contributors.

===Consensus-based=== 
A protocol is a common language. Hence it seems to be a good thing to elaborate it jointly. Since the protocols that come out of this project have to be secure against all sorts of attacks, and may eventually serve as a basis for an exchange-based economy, it is important that designers be warned of all foreseeable caveats. We believe that only a consensus-based design can provide this degree of awareness.
