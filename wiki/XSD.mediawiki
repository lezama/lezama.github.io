XML Schema Definition is a schema language that allow users to define XML structures. It has become a W3C recommendation.

== Referencing a XML Schema ==

When we have an XML document whose structure conforms to a given structure, we may want to reference to the XSD document where that structure is located. This is done with the ''schemaLocation'' attribute at the root element. Here is an example of how this works on the SXPContract Schema:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<contract xmlns="http://www.w3schools.com"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
'''xsi:schemaLocation'''="urn:oasis:names:tc:eContracts:1:0 SXPContract.xsd">

This attribute has two values, separated by a space. The first value is the namespace to use, and it has to be the same as the one declared in the XSD document under the attribute ''targetNamespace''. The second value is the location of the XML schema to use for that namespace.
