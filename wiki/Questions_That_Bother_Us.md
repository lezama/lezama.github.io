Money versus Electronic Bartering Systems
-----------------------------------------

*Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but suddenly
forgot all about money. Would mankind immediately reinvent the concept,
and trust the pieces of paper back again? Or would it make use of the
powerful information technologies available in order to come up with
some advanced, decentralized electronic bartering system?*

### Spontaneous forms of Money within Electronic Bartering Systems

*Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., and say that
all of its trades were taking place via some advanced, decentralized,
electronic bartering system. Would one of the resources being exchanged
re-emerge as a currency, i.e. serve for wealth cumulation and
participate in most deals? Or would more dynamical, blended and local
currencies start to emerge?*
