*Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but suddenly
forgot all about money. Say that all of its trades were taking place via
some advanced, decentralized, electronic bartering system...*

-   Would one of the resources being exchanged re-emerge as an exclusive
    money, i.e. serve for wealth cumulation and participate in all
    deals?
-   Would mankind trust pieces of paper back again?
-   Or would more dynamical, blended and local currencies start to
    emerge?
-   Is there a good theory of emergence of moneys in distributed,
    decentralized economies?
