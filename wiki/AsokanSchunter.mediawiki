The link does not grant access to the whole document, however I recovered it by other means.
This is a recent review paper by specialists, hence a good entry to the topic.
The comments here are biased towards SXP. 

= Fair Exchange =

Describes fair exchange protocols as ways to exchange things between distrustful parties in such a way that either both parties receive what they expect or neither parties does. Includes receipts for payments, certified mail, and contract signatures more specfically.

= Types of Fair Exchanges (FX) =

== With a Trusted Third Party (TTP) ==

Requires a referee. In the setting of SXP, maybe the market could maybe play such a role.
The protocols that do that have a common pattern. 
As usual Alice (A) and Bob (B) are the normal parties, and Trent (T) is the Trusted Third Party. 
They seek to exchange M_A and M_B.
Moreover see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol_notation here] for the notation.

:<math>A\rightarrow B:\{M_A\}_{K}</math>
:<math>A\rightarrow T:K</math>
:<math>B\rightarrow T:M_B</math>
:<math>T\rightarrow B:K</math>
:<math>T\rightarrow B:K</math>

== Being Optimistic ==

Does not require a referee, unless there is a conflict.

=== Optimistic FX ===
=== Verifiable escrow of digital signatures ===
=== Verifiable escrow using pre-issued coupons ===

== Exchanging in parts ==
