Style of expected contributions
-------------------------------

The SXP ideas naturally lead to interesting considerations in terms of
the potential societal impact of such a system. These considerations are
most welcome, so long as they do not prevent the technical progression
of the project, which remains our main objective. Therefore such
discussions will be contained to [discussion
pages](/wiki/Category%3ADiscussion_Pages "wikilink"), dedicated to specific
questions, and having specific formats, e.g. Pros and Cons as in [this
page](/wiki/Exclusive_Money_Based_Economy "wikilink"). The direct impact of
such discussion pages will only be to help us take the right design
decisions, on how to best conceive these protocols, whenever these
technical decisions can help improve the Pros and limit the Cons, or
help support future foreseen features.

Hence, contributors are expected to understand that the SXP protocol is
essentially a generalization of current payment protocols, allowing
anyone to exchange anything, anywhere and with anybody - in a secure
way. And to believe that this is worth the shot. Moreover, contributors
are expected to bring new questions and solutions in an *orderly
fashion*, towards the accomplishment of the project.
