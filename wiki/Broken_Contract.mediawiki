Secure multi-party contracts. Thus, in case one breaks the contract, another can prove that the contract has been established. Still, for this to be of some effect, one needs a guarantee policy, an insurance policy, a trust system, or even a judiciary system that are willing to back up the contract... These may be provided by the virtual markets or via a wider legal context. But SXP does not promote any such policies or systems in particular.
