Take p a prime and g an integer. The powers of g form a subgroup Gq (having q elements) inside the group Zp (having p elements), which is that of integers modulo p. The choice of these p and q is important so that they meet the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption Decisional Diffie-Hellman] assumption; but there are standard techniques for doing that. Thanks to that:

:Alice encrypts <math>m\in G_q</math> as <math>\{m\}_{PubKB}=(y^rm,g^r)</math>.
:Bob decrypts <math>(a,b)</math> as </math>a/b^x</math>.
