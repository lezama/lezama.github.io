This paper is referenced by [AsokanSchunter](/wiki/AsokanSchunter "wikilink")
and [MukhamedovRyan](/wiki/MukhamedovRyan "wikilink"). According to the
latter, it is an abuse-free asynchronous multi-party optimistic contract
signing protocols. Say there are *n* parties:

-   it requires *(n+1)n(n-1)* messages;
-   the end signed result is *(C,n+1)*, thus the contract *C* has to
    specify *n*.
