Bartering

-   Argentina 2002.
-   According to [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter): *In Spain,
    there is a growing number of exchange markets. These barter markets
    or swap meets work without money. Participants bring things they do
    not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of
    another participant. Swapping among three parties often helps
    satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is
    not allowed. See also
