Private Contract Signatures are a cryptography primitive which we need for the [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol]].

Those are constructed via non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs constructions, and based upon the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption Decisional Diffie-Hellman] assumption.

It was introduced in [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.118.4142 Abuse-free optimistic contract signing] by Garay, Jakobsson, MacKenzie (1999).
Comment on the usefulness of this paper to the project [[GarayJakobssonMackenzie|here]]. 

This page aims to give an outline of how they work, and how to implement them.

== Some Cryptography ==

The following must be understood first. In particular, the description of PCS we give uses the notations introduced there.

Outline of [[ElGamalSchnorr|ElGamal encryption]], which are encryption and signature schemes.

Outline of [[Sigma_Protocols|Sigma protocols]], which are composable, interactive zero-knowledge proof schemes.

== Scheme ==



:<math>\textrm{PCS}_B^A(m)=\left((\textrm{CCE}^T(0,n)\wedge\textrm{Schnorr}_B)\vee(\textrm{CCE}^T(1,n)\wedge\textrm{Schnorr}_A)\right)(H(g^s,m))</math>
with s random.

Why not try
:<math>\textrm{PCS}_B^A(m)=\left(\textrm{CCE}^T(0,(g^{\textrm{Priv}_B},v))\vee(\textrm{CCE}^T(1,(g^{\textrm{Priv}_B},v))\wedge\textrm{Schnorr}_A)\right)(H(g^s,m))</math>
with s random?
