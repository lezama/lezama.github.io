Private Contract Signatures are a cryptography primitive which we need for the [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol]].

Those are constructed via non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs constructions, and based upon the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption Decisional Diffie-Hellman] assumption.

It was introduced in [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.118.4142 Abuse-free optimistic contract signing] by Garay, Jakobsson, MacKenzie (1999).
