An electronic contract is a legally binding document, electronically
signed by the different parties, where the parties engage in doing or
giving something in due time. Being able to exchange contracts means
being able to exchange anything from goods to services, by being able to
settle a barter, a payment, or any combination of both.

More concretely, SXP will include:

-   a standardized [XML](/wiki/XML "wikilink") format for describing items to
    be exchanged. [More on
    specifying items.](/wiki/Items_Specification "wikilink")
-   a standardized [XML](/wiki/XML "wikilink") format for terms of contracts.
    [More on specifying contracts.](/wiki/Contracts_Specification "wikilink")
-   a secure way to proceed to their signature, as the
    bottom-layer protocol. [More on the Secure Contract
    Signing protocol.](/wiki/Secure_Contract_Signing_Protocol "wikilink")
-   an authentication architecture for identifying parties.
