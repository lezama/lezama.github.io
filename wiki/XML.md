What is XML?
------------

XML is a tunable tag language for describing things in a hierarchical,
formatted manner. For instance HTML, the language of all webpages, is a
tuned version of XML.

XML is not particularly elegant, but it has become a standard. As a
consequence:

-   there are many tools around for manipulating XML.
-   there may already by some tuned versions of XML for specifying
    [items](/wiki/Items_Specification "wikilink") and
    [contracts](/wiki/Contracts_Specification "wikilink"), which is what
    we want.
-   once GUIs will be developed none will have to see the
    underlying XML.

Here are the obvious pages about XML:
