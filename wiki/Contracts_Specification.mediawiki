These specifications will be done in [[XML]].

Actually, they may already exist. A bibliography of existing XML formats for describing the possible terms of an electronic [[Contracts|contract]]... is the first thing we need.

== Existing XML standards for describing contracts ==

* '''Legal XML eContracts (OASIS Standard).''' 
Legal XML is an XML schema for describing the generic structure of a wide range of contract documents.

This standard uses basic building blocks called ''items'', for the description of the classical notions of clauses or sections. It also uses blocks called ''party'', ''date'', ''party-signature''. Then it encloses these informations under the tags ''contract-front'', ''body'' and ''back'', emulating the structure of a real paper-based contract.

More detailed description at the [http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-econtracts/CS01/legalxml-econtracts-specification-1.0.pdf eContracts Specification 1.0].

* '''Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML).''' ebXML is a family of XML standards that provides an infrastructure for electronic bussiness.

In ebXML, contracts are not defined in a single document â€” instead , the trading partners may form a contract by exchanging requesting documents constituting ''binding offers'', and responding documents constituting ''binding acceptances'', resulting in a demonstrably successful or failed negotiation of the business terms proposed in the offer.

For more information, read the [http://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do E-Commerce Patterns v1.0] Technichal Report, from the ebXML specification.

* '''Financial Product Markup Language (FpML).'''
FpML is a XML standard for describing OTC derivatives.
