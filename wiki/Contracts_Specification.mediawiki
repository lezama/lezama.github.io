These specifications will be done in [[XML]].

Actually, they may already exist. A bibliography of existing XML formats for describing the possible terms of an electronic [[Contracts|contract]]... is the first thing we need.

== Existing XML standards for describing contracts ==

* Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML). ebXML is a family of XML standards that provides an infrastructure for electronic bussiness.

In ebXML, contracts are not defined in a single document - instead , the trading partners may form a contract by exchanging requesting documents constituting ''binding offers'', and responding documents constituting ''binding acceptances'', resulting in a demonstrably successful or failed negotiation of the business terms proposed in the offer.

For more information, read the [http://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do E-Commerce Patterns v1.0] Technichal Report, from the ebXML specification.


* Financial Product Markup Language (FpML). FpML is a XML standard for describing OTC derivatives.

* Legal XML eContracts Standard. It is an XML schema for describing the generic structure of a wide range of contract documents.
