'''A soft alternative to an exclusive money-based economy.'''

''(Project launched: 24th of April 2012.)''

Fast link: [[Private Contract Signatures | PCS]]

==In short==
''A project to create an open, ubiquitous, peer-to-peer, secure protocol suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.''

The idea is that any of us can join together and create a virtual ad hoc market, in which others can tell what they have to offer and what they need. The market, or anyone for that matter, can propose deals, whereby one person would give an item to another who gives an item to a third etc. If all parties concerned agree to a deal, the deal gets secured into an electronic contract, signed by the different parties.

Hence our motto could be: ''Securely exchange anything, anywhere, with anyone.''

==Stages==
The foreseen stages of the project are: 
# Know what the protocols aim to achieve
# Know very precisely what the protocols will achieve
# Formalize the required properties of the protocols
# Formalize candidate protocols 
# Prove the protocols have the required properties
# Launch the implementations of these protocols
# Produce the graphical interfaces to these implementations
# Play with it
The initiators' main role is to ensure that these original aims will not be altered in the course of the project. Stage 1 is the only non-negociable part of this project.

==Status==

Mostly the project is at stage 1: we know the aims of this project. 
Some subtasks are more advanced, for instance:
* The design the [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol|Secure Contract Signing protocol]] is stage 4.

The next tasks belong to stage 2, which is still very much a research stage. Here are some of the most obvious tasks:
* Understand [[Private Contract Signatures]].
* Describe the XML format of [[Contracts]].

==Methodology==

===Top-down===
The design approach is top-down: we need to know what we want better and better, with increased precision, until the stage where knowing what we want means having it.

===Collaborative=== 
The other stages are entirely in the hands of the community that will develop the project. Notice that this is eased by the fact that until stage 6 is reached, no software development is needed. Hence everything can happen on this Website, or links to contributing papers, until then. This website as you may notice is a Wiki: we hope that its content will converge to a consensus reached by its contributors.

===Consensus-based=== 
A protocol is a common language. Hence it seems to be a good thing to elaborate it jointly. Since the protocols that come out of this project have to be secure against all sorts of attacks, and may eventually serve as a basis for an exchange-based economy, it is important that designers be warned of all foreseeable caveats. We believe that only a consensus-based design can provide this degree of awareness.

==Current needs==
We call on:
* Security protocol experts, peer-to-peer protocol experts, to help us design the protocols
* Programmers in general
* Economists to help us refine the [[:Category:Discussion Pages|discussions]], which may help us to take some design decisions
* Infographists, publicists to help put these ideas forward in a clear manner, perhaps in small cartoon/video 
* All good wills, to do whatever they understood might be useful

==Getting started==
Contributing to this project means setting up an account on this Wiki, and making this website grow in an orderly fashion, by bringing in your own expertise. Here are some more informations about [[Getting Started]].

==Questions that bother us==
''Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but suddenly forgot all about money. Say that all of its trades were taking place via some advanced, decentralized, electronic bartering system... Would one of the resources being exchanged re-emerge as an exclusive money, i.e. serve for wealth cumulation and participate in all deals? Would mankind trust pieces of paper back again? Or would more dynamic, blended and local currencies start to emerge? Is there a good theory of emergence of moneys in distributed, decentralized economies?''
