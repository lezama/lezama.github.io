'''A soft alternative to an exclusively money-based economy.'''

''(Project due to be launched: April 2012.)''

==In short.==
''A project to create an open, ubiquitous, peer-to-peer, secure protocol suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.''

In simpler words the idea is that any of us can join together and create a virtual market, in which others can tell what they have to offer and what they need. The market, or anyone for that matter, can propose deals, whereby one person gives an item to another who gives an item to a third etc. If everyone agrees to it, the deal can be secured into an electronic contract, signed by the different parties.

''Hence our motto could be: "Securely exchange anything, anywhere, with everyone."''

==Why do this?==
Solely money-based economy seems quite natural to all of us. Yet, taking a step back, it has a few downsides: 

* It triggers sometimes counter-productive wealth cumulation behaviours.
* It is often unclear who controls/produces money and for what purpose. Nowadays, are Central Banks producing the money, or Private Banks?
* Whenever money runs out, many exchanges that could still have taken place, can no longer take place.
* Money favours deals in which the relative value of items is made uniform across large regions and populations. 

Of course money is not an absolute of people's merit, and nor is it an absolute scale on which to measure all things. But what is it, then? Mainly, it is an instrument for facilitating exchanges. As such it has both [[Exclusively Money Based Economy|advantages and disadvantages]]. We take the view that whatever can be made in order to facilitate exchanges, is worth doing for the economy. 

There are a number of [[Related Projects|related projects]] seeking to address the above-mentioned downsides. The idea of going for Secure eXchange Protocols has been envisioned by others in the past, see [[Related Articles|related articles]]. Certainly, having such protocols implemented would come as handy in a number of [[Related Situations|related situations]]. The aim of this project is to make these protocols a reality. [[Why Do This|More on why we should do this]].

==What is it?==

''Say Alice, Bob, and Charlie have access to different resources ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. Say Alice wants ''b'', Bob wants ''c'' and Charlie wants ''a'', but they do not know each other, nor do they trust each other. By-the-way those ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be anything, e.g ''a'' the ability to give maths lessons, ''b'' some barrel of beer, and ''c'' coins from a certain currency. Finally, say Alice, Bob and Charlie have an iPhone, Android, or whatever Smart Phone in their pockets. Using Secure eXchange Protocols on their Smart Phones, they should be able to quickly declare their resources and needs on virtual ad hoc markets, which in turn should detect and propose the obvious deal between them. If the three of them accept the deal, then an electronic contract will be secured, which is a formal proof of their agreement to perform the swap.''

Let us now explain what is meant by an open, ubiquitous, peer-to-peer, secure protocol suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.

===Protocols.===
A protocol is an agreed common language, and an agreed series of steps, designed in order to achieve some task, over the network. 
[[Protocols|More on protocols.]]

===Contracts.===
An electronic contract is a legally binding document, electronically signed by the different parties, where the parties engage in doing or giving something in due time. Hence, being able to exchange contracts means being able to exchange anything from goods to services. A protocol will serve to settle a barter, a payment, or any combination of both.  
[[Contracts|More on contracts.]]

===Multi-party exchanges: Chains.===
A clear disadvanatage of bartering versus paying is that in a barter, both parties must be interested in each others items, whereas in a payment, the vendor can take the money and spend it, later, on some other item. Here we will seek to compensate for this downside by allowing exchanges between many parties at the same time, as well as facilitating further exchanges of newly acquired items. 
[[Chains|More on chains.]]

===Multi-party exchanges: Markets.===
In the real world shops or markets have several beneficial roles: they facilitate offer/demand encounter, they secure the producer/consumer exchange, they guarantee the quality of the items, they generate VAT for the good functioning of states. The protocols will allow for virtual counterparts of these markets, accomplishing just the same purposes. 
[[Markets|More on markets.]]

===Multi-party exchanges: Deals. ===
Hence cross-market exchanges will often happen. Part of the diffucilty is to compute possible multi-party exchange chains, also referred to as deals. The protocol will promote openness for facilitating the computation of the best possible deals within a market. Moreover since they will run the same protocols, markets will be interoperable. 
[[Deals|More on deals]].

===Peer-to-peer.===
SXP protocols should run in the most decentralized manner as possible, allowing for ad hoc exchanges, market creation, deal exploration under dynamical, reconfigurable scenarios. For instance, an electronic signature is what identifies a market, not its IP address, which may change. This is for the sake of resiliency and monopoly avoidance.

===Ubiquitous.===
SXP protocols should be able to run on mobiles phones.

===Open.===
SXP protocols should be totally open and free. This is the only things that its [[Licence|license]] should enforce.

==Who are we?==
This initiative comes from:
* Pablo Arrighi, lecturer in Computer Science
* Alex Concha, programmer, security expert
* Miguel Lezama, programmer, web expert

As the project develops we plan to take a non-profit NGO status, and disappear in the shade of the most active and competent contributors.

==Stages==
The foreseen stages of the project are: 
# Know what the protocols aim to achieve
# Know very precisely what the protocols will achieve
# Formalize the required properties of the protocols
# Formalize candidate protocols 
# Prove the protocols have the required properties
# Launch the implementations of these protocols
# Produce the graphical interfaces to these implementations
# Play with it

==Status==
The project is at the end of stage 1: we know just the aims of this project. The initiators' main role is to ensure that these original aims will not be altered in the course of the project. Stage 1 is the only non-negociable part of this project. 

The next tasks belong to stage 2, which is still very much a research stage. Here are some of the most obvious tasks:
* design the [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol|Secure Contract Signing protocol]];
* design how to describe [[Contracts]]

==Methodology==

===Top-down===
The design approach is top-down: we need to know what we want better and better, with increased precision, until the stage where knowing what we want means having it.

===Collaborative=== 
The other stages are entirely in the hands of the community that will develop the project. Notice that this is eased by the fact that until stage 6 is reached, no software development is needed. Hence everything can happen on this Website, or links to contributing papers, until then. This website as you may notice is a Wiki: we hope that its content will converge to a consensus reached by its contributors.

===Consensus-based=== 
A protocol is a common language. Hence it seems to be a good thing to elaborate it jointly. Since the protocols that come out of this project have to be secure against all sorts of attacks, and may eventually serve as a basis for an exchange-based economy, it is important that designers be warned of all foreseeable caveats. We believe that only a consensus-based design can provide this degree of awareness.

==Current needs==
We call on:
* Security protocol experts, peer-to-peer protocol experts, to help us design the protocols
* XML experts, to help us design contracts specifications
* Economists to help us refine the [[:Category:Discussion Pages|discussions]], which may help us to take some design decisions
* Infographists, publicists to help put these ideas forward in a clear manner, perhaps in small cartoon/video 
* Lawyers, to help us out with setting the appropriate free software [[Licence|license]]
* All good wills, to do whatever they understood might be useful
One day we may ask for donations to help the project management and development, and which will be handled with full transparency.

==Getting started==
Contributing to this project means setting up an account on this Wiki, and making this website grow in an orderly fashion, by bringing in your own expertise. Here are some more informations about [[Getting Started]].

==Questions that bother us==
* Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but suddenly forgot all about money. Would mankind immediately reinvent the concept, and trust the pieces of paper back again? Or would it make use of the powerful information technologies available in order to come up with some advanced, decentralized electronic bartering system?
* Say that mankind had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., and say that all of its trades were taking place via some advanced, decentralized, electronic bartering system. Would one of the resources being exchanged re-emerge as a currency, i.e. serve for wealth cumulation and participate in most deals? Or would more dynamical, blended and local currencies start to emerge?
