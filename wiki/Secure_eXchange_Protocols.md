**A soft alternative to an exclusive money-based economy.**

Fast link: [Development Portal.](/wiki/Development_Portal "wikilink")

In short
--------

*A project to create an open, ubiquitous, peer-to-peer, secure protocol
suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.*

The idea is that any of us can join together and create a virtual ad hoc
market, in which others can tell what they have to offer and what they
need. The market, or anyone for that matter, can propose deals, whereby
one person would give an item to another who gives an item to a third
etc. If all parties concerned agree to a deal, the deal gets secured
into an electronic contract, signed by the different parties.

Hence our motto could be: *Securely exchange anything, anywhere, with
anyone.*

A question
----------

*Say we had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but suddenly forgot all
about money. Say that all of its trades were taking place via some
advanced, decentralized, electronic bartering system... Would one of the
resources being exchanged re-emerge as an exclusive money, i.e. serve
for wealth cumulation and participate in all deals? Would people trust
pieces of paper back again? Or would more dynamic, blended and local
currencies start to emerge? Is there a good theory of emergence of
moneys in distributed, decentralized economies?* More on [these
questions](/wiki/Questions_That_Bother_Us "wikilink").
