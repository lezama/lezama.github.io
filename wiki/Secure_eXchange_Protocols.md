**A soft alternative to an exclusively money-based economy.**

*(Project due to be launched: March 2012.)*

What is it?
-----------

*A project to create an open, ubiquous, peer-to-peer, secure protocol
suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.*

In simpler words the idea is that any of us can join together and create
a virtual market, in which others can tell what they have to offer and
what they need. The market, or anyone for that matter, can propose
deals, whereby one person gives an item to another who gives an item to
a third etc. If everyone agrees to it, the deal can be secured into an
electronic contracts, signed by the different parties.

*Hence our motto could be: "Securely exchange anything, anywhere, with
everyone."*

Why do this?
------------

Solely money-based economy seems quite natural to all of us. Yet, taking
a step back, it has a few downsides:

-   It triggers sometimes counter-productive wealth
    cumulation behaviours.
-   It is often unclear who controls/produces money and for
    what purpose. Nowadays, are Central Banks producing the money, or
    Private Banks?
-   Whenever money runs out, many exchanges that could still have taken
    place, can no longer take place.
-   Money favours deals in which the relative value of items is made
    uniform across large regions and populations.

Money is not a way to measure people's merit. Nor is it an absolute
scale on which to measure all things. Money is a instrument for
facilitating exchanges. As such it has [advantages and
disandvantages](/wiki/Exclusively_Money_Based_Economy "wikilink"). Our view is
that whatever can be made in order to facilitate exchanges, is worth
doing for the economy. [More on why we should do
this](/wiki/Why_Do_This "wikilink").

How would that work?
--------------------

Let us explain what is meant by an open, ubiquous, peer-to-peer, secure
protocol suite for multi-party exchanges of contracts.

### Protocols.

A protocol is an agreed common language, and an agreed series of steps,
designed in order to achieve some task, over the network. [More on
protocols.](/wiki/Protocols "wikilink")

### Contracts.

An electronic contract is a legally binding document, electronically
signed by the different parties, where the parties engage in doing
something in due time. Being able to exchange contracts means being able
to exchange anything from goods to services, by being able to settle a
barter, a payment, or any combination of both. [More on
contracts.](/wiki/Contracts "wikilink")

### Multi-party exchanges: Chains.

A clear disadvanatage of bartering versus paying is that in a barter,
both parties must be interested in each others items, whereas in a
payment, the vendor can take the money and spend it, later, on some
other item. Here however we will compensate for this downside by
allowing exchanges between many parties at the same time, and
facilitating further exchanges of newly acquired items. [More on
chains.](/wiki/Chains "wikilink")

### Multi-party exchanges: Markets.

In the real world shops or markets have several beneficial roles: they
facilitate offer/demand encounter, they secure the producer/consumer
exchange, they guarantee the quality of the items, they generate VAT for
the good functioning of states. The protocol will allow for virtual
counterparts of these markets, accomplishing just the same role. [More
on markets.](/wiki/Markets "wikilink")

### Multi-party exchanges: Deals.

Since they will run the same protocol, markets will be interoperable.
Hence cross-market exchanges will often happen. Part of the diffucilty
is to compute possible multi-party exchange chains, also referred to as
deals. The protocol will promote openness for facilitating the
computation of the best possible deals. [More on
deals](/wiki/Deals "wikilink").

### Peer-to-peer.

SXP protocols should run in the most decentralized manner as possible,
allowing for ad hoc exchanges, market creation, deal exploration under
dynamical, reconfigurable scenarios. For instance, an electronic
signature is what identifies a market, not its IP adress, which may
constantly change. This design choice is both for the sake of resiliency
and monopoly avoidance.

### Ubiquous.

SXP protocols should be able to run on mobiles phones.

### Open.

SXP protocols should be totally open and free. This is the only things
that its [license](/wiki/Licence "wikilink") should enforce.

Who are we?
-----------

The founders are

-   Pablo Arrighi, lecturer in Computer Science
-   Alex Concha, programmer, security expert
-   Miguel Lezama, programmer, web expert

As the project unravels we plan to take a non-profit NGO status, and
disappear in the shade of the most active and competent contributors.

Stages
------

Stages. The foreseen stages of the project are:

1.  Know what the protocols aim to achieve
2.  Know very precisely what the protocols will achieve
3.  Formalize the required properties of the protocols
4.  Formalize candidate protocols
5.  Prove the protocols have the required properties
6.  Launch the implementations of these protocols
7.  Produce the graphical interfaces to these implementations
8.  Play with it

Status
------

The project is at the end of stage 1: we know just the aims of this
project. The founders' main role is to ensure that these original aims
will not be altered in the course of the project. Stage 1 is the only
non-negociable part of this project. The next tasks belong to stage 2,
here are some of the most obvious tasks:

-   designing the [Secure Contract Signing
    protocol](/wiki/Secure_Contract_Signing_Protocol "wikilink");
-   designing how to describe [Contracts](/wiki/Contracts "wikilink").

Methodology
-----------

### Top-down

The design approach is top-down: we need to know what we want better and
better, with increased precision, until the stage where knowing what we
want means having it.

### Collaborative

The other stages are entirely in the hands of the community that will
develop the project. Notice that this is eased by the fact that until
stage 6 is reached, no software development is needed. Hence everything
can happen on this Website, or links to contributing papers, until then.
This website as you may notice is a Wiki, meaning that its content will
converge to a consensus reached by its contributors.

### Consensus-based

A protocol is a common language. Hence it seems to be a good thing to
elaborate it jointly. Since these protocols hope to serve as a basis for
an exchange-based economy, it is important that designers be warned of
all foreseeable caveats. Again only a consensus-based design can provide
this degree of awareness.

Current needs
-------------

We call on:

-   Economists to help us refine the
    [discussions](/wiki/Discussion_Pages "wikilink"), and thus take the best
    design decisions
-   Security protocol experts, peer-to-peer protocol experts, to help us
    design the protocols
-   Xml experts, to help us design contracts specifications
-   Infographists, publicists to help put these ideas forward in a
    graphical, clear manner
-   Lawyers, to help us out with setting the appropriate free software
    [license](/wiki/Licence "wikilink")
-   Journalists, to propagate this call
-   All good wills, to do whatever they understood might be useful

One day we may ask for donations to help the project management and
development, and which will be handled with full transparency.

Get started
-----------

Contributing to this project means setting up an account on this Wiki,
and making it grow in an orderly fashion, by bringing your own
expertise. Here are some more informations about [Getting
Started](/wiki/Getting_Started "wikilink").

Questions that bother us
------------------------

-   Say that humanity had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., but
    suddenly forgot all about money. Would humanity immediately reinvent
    this concept and trust paper notes back again? Or would it make use
    of its powerful information technologies in order to settle with
    some advanced, decentralized, electronic bartering system?
-   Say that humanity had all these mobile phones, PDAs etc., and say
    that all of its trades would take place via some advanced,
    decentralized, electronic bartering system. Would one of the
    resources being exchanged re-emerge as a currency, i.e. serve for
    wealth cumulation and participate in all deals? Or would more
    dynamical, blended and local currencies start to emerge?
