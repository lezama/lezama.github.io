[[Category:Glossary]] 

An electronic contract is a legally binding document, electronically signed by the different parties, where the parties engage in doing or giving something in due time. Being able to exchange contracts means being able to exchange anything from goods to services, by being able to settle a barter, a payment, or any combination of both.  

More concretely, SXP will include:
* a standardized [[XML]] format for describing items to be exchanged. [[Items Specification|More on specifying items.]]
* a standardized [[XML]] format for terms of contracts.  [[Contracts Specification|More on specifying contracts.]]
* a secure way to proceed to their signature, as the bottom-layer protocol.  [[Secure Contract Signing Protocol|More on the Secure Contract Signing protocol.]]
