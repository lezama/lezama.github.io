This initiative comes from:

-   Pablo Arrighi, full professor in Computer Science
-   Miguel Lezama, programmer, web expert
-   Kevin Perrot, associate professor in Computer Science

who have authored most contributions so far. As the project develops,
they hope to disappear in the shade of the most active and competent
contributors.

The initial website was set up by Alex Concha, progammer, security
expert. The XML formats are being defined by Mario Junquera Villa,
Master student in Informatics.
