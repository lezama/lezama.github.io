These specifications will be done in [XML](/wiki/XML "wikilink").

Actually, they may already exist. A bibliography of existing XML formats
for describing the possible terms of an electronic
[contract](/wiki/Contracts "wikilink")... is the first thing we need.

Existing XML standards for describing contracts
-----------------------------------------------

-   **Legal XML eContracts (OASIS Standard).**

Legal XML is an XML schema for describing the generic structure of a
wide range of contract documents.

This standard uses basic building blocks called *items*, for the
description of the classical notions of clauses or sections. It also
uses blocks called *party*, *date*, *party-signature*. Then it encloses
these informations under the tags *contract-front*, *body* and *back*,
emulating the structure of a real paper-based contract.

More detailed description at the [eContracts Specification
1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-econtracts/CS01/legalxml-econtracts-specification-1.0.pdf).

-   **Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML).**
    ebXML is a family of XML standards that provides an infrastructure
    for electronic bussiness.

In ebXML, contracts are not defined in a single document â€” instead , the
trading partners may form a contract by exchanging requesting documents
constituting *binding offers*, and responding documents constituting
*binding acceptances*, resulting in a demonstrably successful or failed
negotiation of the business terms proposed in the offer.

For more information, read the [E-Commerce Patterns
v1.0](http://ebxml.org/specs/bpPATT.pdf) Technichal Report, from the
ebXML specification.

-   **Financial Product Markup Language (FpML).**

FpML is a XML standard for describing OTC derivatives.
