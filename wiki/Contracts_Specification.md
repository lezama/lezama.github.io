These specifications will be done in [XML](/wiki/XML "wikilink").

Actually, they may already exist. A bibliography of existing XML formats
for describing the possible terms of an electronic
[contract](/wiki/Contracts "wikilink")... is the first thing we need.

Existing XML standards for describing contracts
-----------------------------------------------

-   Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML). ebXML
    is a family of XML standards that provides an infrastructure for
    electronic bussiness.

In ebXML, contracts are not defined in a single document: instead of
that, the trading partners may form a contract by exchanging requesting
documents constituting *binding offers*, and responding documents
constituting *binding acceptances*, resulting in a demonstrably
successful or failed negotiation of the business terms proposed in the
offer.

For more information, read the [E-Commerce Patterns
v1.0](http://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do) Technichal Report, from the
ebXML specification.

-   Financial Product Markup Language (FpML). FpML is a XML standard for
    describing OTC derivatives.

<!-- -->

-   Legal XML eContracts Standard. It is an XML schema for describing
    the generic structure of a wide range of contract documents.
