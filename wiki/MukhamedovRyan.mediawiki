Provides abuse-free asynchronous multi-party optimistic contract signing.

It says that there are only two competitors doing just that:
* Garay and MacKenzie, whose security has been put at stake.
* [[BaumwaidnerWaidner]].

Let ''n'' be the number of parties. This protocol requires ''n(n-1)(n/2)+1'' messages. It relies on Private Contract Signature.

== Private Contract Signatures (PCS) ==

PCS_P_i(C,P_j,T) denotes a Private Contract Signatures by P_i for P_j on contract C with Trusted Third Party T. The object is such that:
* It can be created by P_i and, in the eyes of an external party, faked by P_j;
* P_i and T are able to convert it into {C}_PrivP_i.

How different is that from the Designated Verifiable Escrows of [[AsokanShunter]] and [[BaumwaidnerWaidner]]? How does it compare in terms of security? We need to find out. Here the further reference on PCS given is [[GarayJakobssonMackenzie]].
