We do the Items Specification via an XML schema (XSD), which is one of
the possible ways to define an XML structure.

SXP Products.xsd

There are some XML schemas for defining products in the most known
e-commerce websites:

-   Amazon
-   Google Shopping

The following services have a product taxonomy, but they do not use XML
schemas (even when they are XML-based):

-   Prestashop
-   Magento
