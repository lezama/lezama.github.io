== Required clauses ==

These are the clauses that the user must fill in for creating a SXP Contract:

** the person responsible
** the legal authority
** the party that should claim the authority

*Objects clause. A reference to the objects that will be exchanged. This reference will be done under the [[Items Specification]]. 

*Delivery clause.
** the person who will pay the delivery of the objects
** when he will do it

*VAT clause. Information about the value-added taxes involved in the exchange.
** the amount
** the authority who will receive the taxes
