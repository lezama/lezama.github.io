This page describes the technichal information about the SXP Contract Definition, which is an extension of OASIS Legal XML eContracts.

== Required clauses ==

These are the clauses that the user must fill in for creating a SXP Contract:

*Parties. Actually, this clause exists at the original Legal XML Specification (at the ''contract-front'' level), but it is not considered mandatory. In our specification it has been set as mandatory.

*Breach clause. A clause that specifies what happens in case of one party doesn't accomplish the contract. It has the following structure:
** Conflict Resolution Mode (mandatory).
***exchange-level. Conflicts are resolved between the parties who needed to exchange items within the contract.
***contract-level. Even local conflicts are resolved by all parties. These are the possibilities:
****defendant country. Complaints are presented at the court of the defendant party's country
****plaintive country. Complaints are presented at the court of the plaintitive party's country
****fixed country. Complaints are presented at the court of a given country
** Trust Rating Adjustements (optional). Information about the adjustements that will be done on the SXP trust rating system.


*Items clause. A reference to the items that will be exchanged. This reference will be done under the [[Items Specification]]. 

*Delivery clause.
** the person who will pay the delivery of the objects
** when he will do it

== Optional clauses ==

*VAT clause. Information about the value-added taxes involved in the exchange.
** the amount
** the authority who will receive the taxes
** the parties responsibles of paying

*Other Clauses. Basically, users can add as many clauses as they want as ''items'', under the ''body'' level. These clauses are intended to contain text that can be read by both parties.

== Minimal example of a SXP Contract==

In this example, we have two parties (Alice and Bob) exchanging objects (a violin and a guitar).

== SXP Contract Schema==

For validating SXP contracts, users must [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4JKZAq0izyxTFl4b0dZX1FXRUk/edit?usp=sharing download the SXP Contract Schema] and the Legal XML eContracts Schema from the [https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalxml-econtracts OASIS LegalXML eContracts Technichal committee website]. Then, contracts can be validated using a XML validator.
