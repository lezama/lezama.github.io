This paper is referenced by [[AsokanSchunter]] and [[MukhamedovRyan]]. It is an abuse-free asynchronous multi-party optimistic contract signing protocols. Say there are ''n'' parties:
* it requires ''(n+1)n(n-1)'' messages which may be high;
* but only ''n+2'' rounds which is optimal;
* in the optimistic case the end signed result is ''(C,n+1)'', thus the contract ''C'' has to specify ''n'';
* but in the pessimistic case the end signed result involves some countersigning by ''T''.
