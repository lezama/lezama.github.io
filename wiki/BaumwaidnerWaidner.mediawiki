This paper is referenced by [[AsokanSchunter]] and [[MukhamedovRyan]]. According to the latter, it is an abuse-free asynchronous multi-party optimistic contract signing protocols. Say there are ''n'' parties:
* it requires ''(n+1)n(n-1)'' messages;
* the end signed result is ''(C,n+1)'', thus the contract has to specify ''n''.
