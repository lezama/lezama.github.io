== Style of expected contributions ==
A word of caution. This website is not so much a place for ideological debates. It is true that the SXP protocol does lead to considerations in terms of the potential political, philosophical, societal impact of such a system. But these could be endless and hence prevent the technical progression of the project. Therefore such discussions will be contained to specific [[Discussion Pages|discussion pages]], dedicated to specific questions, and having specific formats, e.g. Pros and Cons as in [[Exclusively Money Based Economy|this page]]. The impact of such discussion pages will only be to help us take the right design decisions, on how to best conceive these protocols, whenever these technical decisions can help improve the Pros and limit the Cons, or help support future foreseen features.

Hence, contributors are expected to understand that the SXP protocol is essentially a generalization of current payment protocols, allowing anyone to exchange anything, anywhere and with anybody - in a secure way. And to believe that this is worth the shot. Moreover, contributors are expected to bring new questions and solutions in an orderly fashion, towards the accomplishment of the project.
