Of course money is not an absolute of people's merit, and nor is it an
absolute scale on which to measure all things. What is it, then? Mainly,
it is an instrument for facilitating exchanges. As such it has both
advantages and disadvantages, which this page seeks to list.

Advantages
----------

Exclusively money-based economy seems quite natural to all of us. I has
clear advantages:

-   It allows for multi-party exchanges
-   It allows for forward-time exchanges

Disadvantages
-------------

Yet, taking a step back and thinking about, one becomes conscious of its
several disadvantages:

-   It triggers sometimes counter-productive wealth
    cumulation behaviours.
-   It is often unclear who controls/produces money and for
    what purpose. Nowadays, are Central Banks producing the money, or
    Private Banks?
-   Whenever money runs out, many exchanges that could still have taken
    place, can no longer take place.
-   Money favours deals in which the relative value of items is made
    uniform across large regions and populations.

Indeed, a more refined point is that, even on a daily basis, money
favours deals in which the relative value of items is made uniform
across large regions and populations. I.e. money makes it difficult to
settle an exchange in which, even if the deal clearly suits all the
parties involved, the deal would seem unfair if rephrased in terms of
standard prices. This point may be a profound one: after all as
individuals we rarely see items as having the same value; otherwise
items would reach some stable distributions amongst us and never be
exchanged again... The entire economy is based on the fact that
different people want different things at different times. Thus, giving
items a single, one-dimensional value may not be optimal in terms of
favouring exchanges, in many situations.
